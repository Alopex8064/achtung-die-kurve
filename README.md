Achtung die Kurve ([Online Demo](http://stravid.com/projects/achtung-die-kurve/))
===

### Description ###
This is a browser game entirely written in JavaScript. The concept is based on a game
called "Achtung die Kurve" what is a very old Borland C++ game. It's also known under the name "Zatacka".

In this game you play a line which can be controlled by any device, usually the keyboard.
The line is constantly moving forward so the player has only control over the direction of the line.
As long as you don't hit any other player or the border your line is constantly growing which will eventually 
lead to a situation where you can't go anywhere without crashing someone or something.
