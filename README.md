This is a browser-game enterily driven by Javascript. The concept is based on a game
called "Achtung die Kurve" what is a a very old Flash based game.

In this game you play a line which can be controlled by any device, usually the keyboard.
By controlling you can decide to curve the line in any direction you desire. As long as you
don't hit any other player of the frame your line is constantly growing which will eventually 
lead to a situation where you can't go anywhere without crashing someone or something.
